        <p>Kyle Addison is a User Experience / User Interaction (UX/UI) Designer & Researcher.
            He specializes in user research and wireframing/prototyping. He has been creative since childhood. He has been performing arts ever since he can remember. From drawing to playing instruments to digital art and design. 
             
            Kyle always tries to see from others perspectives. His compassion and empathy for others has built a strong quality for problem solving (especially for fellow humans…and animals). He is a huge animal lover particularly for his corgi/aussie, Walter.
             
            Kyle has interest in many branches of UX/UI design and seeks to learn more about them. Kyle’s heart and passion lies in video games and hopes to achieve a career in the gaming industry. He knows he would enjoy designing HUDs (heads-up display), menus, ect. but feels that games might not be getting enough user testing and feedback before their release date. VR (virtual reality) is also growing in popularity with some users experiencing difficulties. Kyle believes that with his knowledge and experience in user research and empathy, he can help.
